# RavishingReads

## Description

The motivation for the project was to create a place where managers of the site can add books in. We also wanted to allow readers to create favorite book lists
Managers of the site can use queries to add to the database of books
User of the site can create lists that they can add books to with functionality to add a note to the book.
This solved the problem of wanting to keep track of read books, and future books. People also forget what they thought about a book so they can add a note for reference.
We learned a lot about react, state, mutations, mongodb, express.js and more

## Installation

Front end we used React and Tailwind
For the database we used MongoDB and Mongoose
We used Express.js for connectivity
Deployment was to [Heroku](https://ravishing-reads-react-fb02d5314bcc.herokuapp.com/)
